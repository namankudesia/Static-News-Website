<center> <font color="red" ><h1> Corona Virus </center></font>
<p> Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus.

Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring special treatment.  Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are more likely to develop serious illness.

The best way to prevent and slow down transmission is to be well informed about the COVID-19 virus, the disease it causes and how it spreads. Protect yourself and others from infection by washing your hands or using an alcohol based rub frequently and not touching your face. 

The COVID-19 virus spreads primarily through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose when an infected person coughs or sneezes, so itâ€™s important that you also practice respiratory etiquette (for example, by coughing into a flexed elbow).</p>

<p><b><center><h1> Coronavirus (COVID-19): Home Care & Precautions </center></b></p>
<p>
As much as possible, keep away from other people and pets in your home.
Wear a cloth face covering (or face mask, if you have one) if they must be around other people.
Cloth face coverings are for use only by people older than 2 years old who are not having trouble breathing.
Do not leave a child alone while they're wearing a cloth face covering. 
To see how to put on and remove cloth face coverings and face masks, clean them, or make your own cloth face covering, 
Cover coughs and sneezes with a tissue, throw the tissue away, and then wash their hands right away. Wash with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, or use alcohol-based hand sanitizer.
Wash the sick person's clothing, bedding, and towels with detergent on the hottest temperature possible. Wear gloves when handling their laundry, if possible. Wash your hands well after handling the laundry (even if you wore gloves).
